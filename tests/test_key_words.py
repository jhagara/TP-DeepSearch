        Clabaugh. The film features several cult favorite actors, including William
        Zabka of The Karate Kid fame, Wil Wheaton, Casper Van Dien, Jenny McCarthy,
        Keith Coogan, Robert Englund (best known for his role as Freddy Krueger in the
        A Nightmare on Elm Street series of films), Dana Barron, David Bowe, and Sean
        Whalen. The film concerns a genetically engineered snake, a python, that
        escapes and unleashes itself on a small town. It includes the classic final
        girl scenario evident in films like Friday the 13th. It was filmed in Los Angeles,
         California and Malibu, California. Python was followed by two sequels: Python
         II (2002) and Boa vs. Python (2004), both also made-for-TV films.""")
